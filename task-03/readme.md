## HELLO,WORLD!

This task was of moderate level for me. Took time to understand the syntax of programming languages. Introduced me to a lot of programming languages, but it was definitely fun!
Haskell was difficult ones for me as the syntax was really different from the others.
Could not attempt the Elixir one as I was having a really bad time grasping the syntax.
