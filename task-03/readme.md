## HELLO,WORLD!

This task was of moderate level for me. Took time to understand the syntax of programming languages. Introduced me to a lot of programming languages, but it was definitely fun!
Haskell and Elixir was difficult ones for me as the syntax was really different from the others, still very confused about the syntax.
