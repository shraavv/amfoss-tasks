# AMFOSS-TASKS

# SELF-INTRO

Hello all!

I am Shravya K Suresh,currently a first year student of CSE batch. Learning new programming languages and and solving problems has always seemed really interesting and fun for me. I have to admit it is frustrating at times but i believe that is what makes the process even more fun!

# INTROSPECTION

## WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?

I was introduced to programming in 11th grade, I was a computer science student. At first, things were quite difficult but once I grasped all the basics, it tuned out to be interesting. I am always up for learning new stuff and exploring different aspects. I think amfoss will help in all aspects. Firstly, in enriching my coding skills and secondly in my problem solving skills. Being a part of this club will also help me grow as an individual by giving me a chance to take part in a lot of events and not limiting myself.

## WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS?

If given the opportunity, I would imporve my coding skills. I would also try my level best to improve myself in competitive programming and API related areas as I found it difficult while doing the tasks. I would also like to explore all the different areas and find my interests.

## HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

I will put in my maximum efforts and be as helpul as I can. I am also ready to go out of my comfort zone, take part in a lot of competitions and bring back good results to the club.

## DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?

I found the last few tasks difficult, they were really time consuming. Apart from that, these tasks exposed me to different parts of computer science and I learnt many new concepts. The starting tasks were all beginner friendly. Overall the whole process was fun and exciting.
